# Employee Hiring Classification For HR
## Project Overview
This GitHub repository contains a data science project focused on employee hiring classification for HR departments.
The primary goal of this project is to predict which employees are likely to leave their job within the company.
By leveraging data analysis and machine learning techniques, we aim to answer critical questions related to employee retention and satisfaction:

Why do employees want to leave?
What motivates employees to stay?
How can HR departments keep employees motivated and engaged?

## Introduction
Employee turnover is a significant concern for organizations, as it can lead to decreased productivity, increased recruitment costs, and a loss of valuable talent.
Understanding the factors that contribute to employees leaving their jobs and identifying strategies to retain them are crucial for HR departments.

## Methods

In this project, we utilized the following libraries and machine learning methods:

- **Libraries**:
  - **Pandas**: Pandas was used for data manipulation and preprocessing, allowing us to explore and clean the dataset efficiently.
  - **NumPy**: NumPy facilitated numerical computations and array operations, which were crucial for feature engineering and data transformations.
  - **Seaborn**: Seaborn was employed for creating informative and visually appealing data visualizations, aiding in data exploration and presentation.
  - **Matplotlib.pyplot**: Matplotlib.pyplot complemented Seaborn for customizing and fine-tuning our data visualizations.

- **Machine Learning Algorithms**:
  - **Logistic Regression**: Logistic Regression was employed as a baseline classification algorithm to predict employee attrition based on the dataset's features.
  - **Random Forest**: Random Forest, an ensemble learning method, was used to improve predictive accuracy by considering decision trees' collective wisdom.
  - **Artificial Neural Network (ANN) with TensorFlow**: We leveraged TensorFlow to build an Artificial Neural Network (ANN), a deep learning technique, for more complex modeling and pattern recognition in the employee attrition prediction task.

The combination of these libraries and machine learning methods allowed us to conduct in-depth analyses and develop robust models to address the key questions related to employee attrition and retention.

## Results
The project's results will be documented in Jupyter notebook within this repository.
The notebook will include code, visualizations, and explanations of the findings.
